  COMP 4995 - Gaming Systems Assignment 3
  by Zac Koop  & Nathan Barber  April 14, 2017
  
  WHAT WORKS:
    - All of A2
    - Picking
    - Particles (snowing) 
    - Basic Mirror reflection (without rotation handling)  -> well it WAS working and I somehow made backwards process and need to fix it...
    - 3D cube, 6 sides reflecting NOPEEEE. 

   
  Controls:
    - Walk with WASD
    - Picking (works most accurate in Full Screen mode)  (mouse click aiming at a mesh object)
    - Left-Click drag around to translate.  Right-Click is rotate
        - Z-axis translate is holding "Shift" while slowly moving the mouse up or down 
          (IT'S VERY SENSITIVE!)
    - Camera controls are the Arrow keys.   R,F are "fly",  N,M are "roll"
    - LIGHTING:  
        - 3: ambient on/off
        - 4: directional light on/off
        - 5: directional light on/off
        - 6: directional light on/off
     - PARTICLES: Snow -> Hold "P" for snowing effect
     - RESET mesh location is "Q"
